to mental health
a poem about
been clean for
a safe space
it is racist
mentally ill people
blocked me for
mental health problems
i am suicidal
mental health services
that feel when
hope i die
i am emo
self harm is
my own fault
im crying so
kill myself and
the scars on
go to therapy
getting bad again
fuck im so
i cut myself
be more active
cut but i
feels that way
to self harm
very sad and
broken i am
a trigger warning
was in hospital
